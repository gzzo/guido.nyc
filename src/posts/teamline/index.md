I wanted to visualize driver movements across teams in Formula 1 over time. Thanks to [Ergast](https://ergast.com/mrd/),
I was able to compile the necessary data into a JSON file that represents team and driver changes for all of Formula 1's
history. Then it was a simple matter of writing a small UI to visualize the data. 

While the app is specific to F1, the concept could be easily used for other sports and leagues.
